## These are the ideas of my own:


### Idea 1: Usage of End-to-End Encryption Instant Messaging softwares in IPv6 Only Environments
**Category :** This is an interdisciplinary topic associated with <span style="color:forestgreen">**Computer Networks**</span> and <span style="color:darkorange">**Cybersecurity**</span> . <br>
**Brief Description:** I think there is no need to say something more about the usage of E2EE IM Softwares in IPv4 Environment. However, what is the condition in IPv6 Environment, especially IPv6-Only Environment?<br>

### Idea 2: Random Order Models' Coloring in the Bipartite Graphes
**Category :** This is a topic associated with <span style="color:royalblue">**Theoretical Computer Science**</span> . <br>
**Brief Description :** We have already known that the situation in Deterministic Order Models' Coloring in the Bipartite Graphes. However, how come when the situation changes to the Random Order Model? This is a question we would like to consider. <br>

### Idea 3: Revolving Doors among Virtual Youtubers, Idols and Livestreamers 
**Category :** This is a topic associated with <span style="color:fuchsia">**Human Computer Interactions**</span> . <br>
**Brief Description :** Nowadays, we can see the activities by Virtual Youtubers, Idols and Livestreamers have become more and more popular. We can observe that it seems the revolving doors among them exist. How do we explain this phenomena in the new era? It is one question that we need to think about.<br>
